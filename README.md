# Bearing fault detection using Deep Learning

Using deep learning methods to classify different type of machine bearing faults.

We use MATLAB and the [MPFT Challenge](https://www.mfpt.org/fault-data-sets/) dataset to train a neural network using transfer learning, on scalograms generated from the vibration 
signals, and their amplitudes as found in the dataset. MATLAB's [Deep Learning Toolbox](https://in.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html) is used to assist us in training the model, which we
observe has a provisional accuracy of 99.42%. Further work is being done and this repository will be updated.

(This work is done under the supervision and at the undertaking of Electrono Solutions)
